<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a second-year student at Vellore Institute of Technology, currently pursuing my undergraduate studies in a technology-focused discipline. My academic journey has been shaped by a strong interest in computer science and software development. I am deeply motivated to explore emerging technologies and build practical solutions that reflect real-world applications.</p>

<p>One of the key projects I have worked on is a Virtual Voice Assistant, which has significantly strengthened my understanding of how artificial intelligence and natural language processing can enhance user interaction. This project allowed me to apply programming concepts in a practical environment, integrating speech recognition, text-to-speech, and command execution functionalities into one cohesive system.</p>

<p>My coursework has equipped me with a strong technical foundation. I have successfully completed subjects such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Python programming, Linear Algebra, Discrete Mathematics, and Design and Analysis of Software Systems and Models (DSSM). These courses have not only developed my coding and problem-solving abilities but also enhanced my logical and analytical thinking skills, which are crucial for any software development role.

Looking ahead, I am eager to take on more challenging projects and continue expanding my knowledge base. I am particularly interested in areas like AI, software architecture, and full-stack development. I value teamwork, continuous learning, and innovation, and I aim to contribute meaningfully to both academic and professional environments as I progress in my career.</p>
